This repository has assignment for DATA-512 - Human Centered Design Project PArt 1 - Common Analysis.

## Goal

We have all been affected by a worldwide pandemic for the past three years. This has had a terrible and disruptive impact on many nations and has had a significant negative personal impact on many people and their families.

The datafication of the pandemic is one feature that has been difficult to ignore during the past three years. In other words, a lot of information on the pandemic's personal cost has been gathered, combined, and presented as data. With the help of this data, we have the opportunity to investigate the pandemic from a variety of prospective angles in order to comprehend how it has affected individuals as well as society. To be completely honest, we are just now beginning to understand and appreciate these effects.

By completing a human-centered data science study of the existing COVID-19 data, we aim to look at some of the social dimensions of the pandemic throughout this course project. Every student in the course will use the same datasets for Part 1: Common Analysis. Students will be given the task of analyzing data for a single US county.

Count Assigned: Maricopa County, Arizona, United States

## Issues and Special Considerations

The code has been accustomed to handle any exceptions occurring with regards to data manipulation operations. Also, if the URL or article titles do not exist, the code wouldn't break and is entirely reproducible. As of now, everything just works fine and we have all the relevant information
